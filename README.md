# Flashcards Game

## Project By: [Alex Sodemann](https://github.com/asodemann18)

## About
In this project, I wrote a program to simulate a set of flash cards through the command line. A user will be able to see the questions, take guesses, and know if they got the question correct.

## Project Goals
* Contribute code to an partially constructed object-oriented application
* Follow spec/prompts to make a working application
* Implement ES6 classes
* Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
* Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
